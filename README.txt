Truly random number generator made using a PSoC 4 CY8CKIT-149 kit and a https://github.com/SensorsIot/Geiger-Counter-RadiationD-v1.1-CAJOE- device. Original idea from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwIGnATzBTg.

If you want to make one of these, you just need the two devices already mentioned and a three digit seven segment display. The FW is set up to use a time multiplexed 3 digit sseg, but could be pretty easily modified to use three 1 digit ssegs if you're not into saving wires.
